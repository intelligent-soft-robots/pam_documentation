# Developer's guide: Updating the documentation

Everybody is welcome to update/extend the documentation.

For doing so:

1. Clone the documentation [repository](https://github.com/intelligent-soft-robots/pam_documentation)
2. Update the documentation
3. If you add a new file: list it in the file index.rst (at the right place, are files are in order)
4. If you add a new file: note that both RST files and MD files are supported. 
5. Check the documentation looks nice locally: you can generate the html files with ```make html``` (see requirements.txt).
6. Push to a branch and perform a pull request to the main branch.

After review and once the branch is merged into th main branch, the online documentation will be automatically updated.
